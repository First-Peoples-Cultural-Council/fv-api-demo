# fv-api-demo
Demo code for the FirstVoices API

# Environment

Prior to building, set environment variables `APIBASE` to the context root of the API server you wish to use and set `TOKEN_ENDPOINT` to the path of the desired Oauth2 TOKEN url.


To build, `npm run dist` will package, or `npm run start` will start a hot-reloading development service on port 5001.
